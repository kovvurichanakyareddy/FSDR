    <p>The Vande Bharat Express[2] is a short-distance train service operated by Indian Railways. Similar to Shatabdi Express, these are day train services that connect major Indian cities which are in a distance of less than a day's time. The trainsets can support semi-high speeds but due to the railway track speed capacity, multiple stoppages and traffic constraints, the operating speed of the services are limited to 160 km/h (99 mph) on a section of the Delhi-Bhopal service and 110–130 km/h (68-81 mph) on other services.[3][4]

        The train, then known as Train 18, was designed by the RDSO and manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF).[5] The specifications were also standardized by the RDSO.[6] It was made for low-cost maintenance and operational optimization. The cost of a 16-coach Vande Bharat train is about ₹115 crore (US$14 million).[7]
        
        On 27 January 2019, the services using Train 18 sets were named Vande Bharat Express with the first service commencing on 15 February 2019.[8]</p>
